</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week I went to a "wake" to commemorate the end of Teletext's public editorial service. It was nice to see some old faces, and it's inspired me to write about why I think the company failed.</p>
<p>I worked at Teletext for a very long time - 1999 to 2007 - and witnessed first-hand a lot of the decisions that made it inevitable that it would close down sooner or later. To be fair, lest anyone think this is just an "if only they'd listened to me..." post, I actually predicted several times that the company only had six months left... starting at least four years ago. So I'm obviously far from infallible on this. </p>
<p>That said, I was involved in some of the high-level strategy stuff for several years. I was senior enough to be a participant in the discussions, even if I never reached a position where I could influence the actual decisions. That's an interesting place to observe a company from, in hindsight, even if it was incredibly frustrating at the time.</p>
<p>So here's some of the conclusions I've drawn from those observations of a company's long drawn-out death.</p>
<p>The most immediately obvious cause of Teletext's demise was its utter failure to understand what the Internet meant. The company took over the ITV/C4 text licence in 1992, well before the Internet had reached any sort of public notice. And yet by the time the web did start to explode - say, 1998 - Teletext was in what should have been an excellent position to take advantage of it. Unlike almost any other media organisation at the time, it was already set up for electronic publishing. It understood rolling deadlines, 24-hour updates, the need for short snippets of information; and it didn't already have a paid-for edition to worry about taking readership away from, as newspapers did. So we should have been all set to clean up.</p>
<p>But the one thing that management never understood was how to operate in a competitive environment. When Teletext started, it quickly became the only place to go to get cheap holidays. And that was because it was, literally, the only place to go. With the exception of bucket shops, there was nowhere else to buy cheap packages. And so, for six or seven years, the company only had to sit back and watch the money roll in. When I joined, it was awash with cash.</p>
<p>As we now know, that couldn't last. Although it didn't exactly come from nowhere, the explosion of the Internet - and with it, a whole range of other places to go to get holidays, news, weather, racing results, and all the other things that Teletext specialised in - seemed to catch management not so much by surprise as almost completely unawares. It really took well into the 2000s, by which time the web had been a mass-market phenomenon for several years, before the company seemed to understand that things had changed and they'd better to do something about it.</p>
<p>Which leads us on to the second failure: the complete lack of leadership. Having realised something needed to be done, there was no-one to decide what it was they should do, or how they should go about it. The managing director, Mike Stewart, was almost the clich√©d definition of the Blarney-kissed Irishman; genial, friendly, endowed with the gift of the gab, and very convincing on a one-to-one level, but absolutely incapable of running a company, or providing a strategic vision and the leadership to see it through. And so the 'leadership thing' was left to percolate down the hierarchy. When I joined, it was provided by the editorial director, a very impressive man called Graham Lovelace. Unfortunately, the company made the mistake of paying for him to do an MBA at Harvard, after which he very sensibly decided he'd go and make his fortune elsewhere. His replacement was of a quite different sort: a man obsessed with company politics, the size of his team, and the minutiae of many different services, to the point where thoughts of strategy and vision were completely eclipsed by concerns about text size and page numbering. </p>
<p>It's not surprising that we were left with a company that had no direction at all - and one in which the direction was provided by whoever shouted the loudest. Most of the time, that was the holidays department, who despite everything were still bringing in the lion's share of the cash. So we had project after project to develop poorly-thought out tools to encourage holiday companies to upload their content to the service. And whenever one of these ended up almost completely unused, as they frequently did since they hadn't been based on any demand from or research among the putative users, management simply blithely carried on to the next expensive project, with not so much as a retrospective glance to work out what had gone wrong.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what little resource was left was dedicated to other projects more or less randomly. An editorial website was built, and it was rather good: news, sport, entertainment, finance, along with some quite nice tools, like a share portfolio tracker, a local cinema search, and a horse racing form data service. But (failure 3, if you're keeping count) the company absolutely failed to build up a proper display sales team, so all this great content on the web, and later digital TV, had almost no accompanying adverts and brought in next to no money. So, surprise surprise, when crunch times started to come in the mid-2000s, the company took what appeared to be the sanest decision: it closed down its website.</p>
<p>Yes. Read that again. A digital publishing company took the decision, against the background of an ever-expanding web audience and market, to close down their website. Note that we're not talking here about immediately after the post-2000 bubble; we're talking about the middle of the next Internet boom, when everyone was once again making big money on the Internet. And Teletext closed down its website.</p>
<p>Of course, this was a completely political decision: the holidays side of the company had the ear of the senior management, while the entire non-holidays side - editorial and display sales - was regarded as a joke. An entirely vicious circle: display sales was seen as being irrelevant, so the team was neglected and usually under-strength, so they didn't sell any adverts, so the non-holidays side was seen as pointless, and so on.</p>
<p>I should point out that this was only one of Teletext's websites: the other was, again surprise surprise, holidays. Now, this was a really bad website. Here's how bad it was: you could search for holidays, but you couldn't book. Instead, you were given a phone number to call to book. This in the days when most people were still on dial-up connections, and not everyone had a mobile, so you would have to actually disconnect from the web in order to book your holiday. And when you did, more often than not you found that the holiday you wanted wasn't available: it had probably been sold weeks ago, as the holiday firms didn't want to use those expensive and complicated tools to keep their inventory in sync.</p>
<p>Still, that website somehow made money. The most likely explanation for this was accounting fiction: companies advertised across platform, so a percentage of the revenue was arbitrarily allocated to the website, even if the advertiser couldn't have cared less about the website. But this was apparently enough to justify the redirection of investment to the holidays brand, to build even more tools and services that weren't used.</p>
<p>The non-holidays side did, however, manage to convince the business to invest in editorial services on digital television. We were allocated space on OnDigital, as it was then, to launch a public-service terrestrial service. Despite great claims that this would allow us, for the first time, to attract big-name advertisers - who until then had refused to advertise on text services because their brand logos couldn't be replicated properly - this service pootled along for a few years almost entirely unencumbered by adverts, once again because of the failure to build up a proper display sales team. It went on the back burner for a while when ITVDigital collapsed, but magically jumped back to top priority when Freeview turned out to be an unexpected (at least, to us) success.</p>
<p>But the big failure of this service was that it was on its own separate channel, 9. For a long time, management did not understand that the main use of Teletext - apart from checking the TV listings, which itself had now been made irrelevant by the digital boxes' built-in programme guides - was to quickly check the headlines or the sport results during the ad breaks in Coronation Street. You couldn't do this with C9 - you had to physically change channel, wait for the service to launch, bear with the excruciatingly slow navigation, during which time your programme had probably started again. On top of which, the digital service - contrary to its initial promise of offering more content, plus pictures - actually had significantly less than the analogue service, and just a single sport picture of the day. Hardly a compelling proposition.</p>
<p>The answer, as we all knew, was to get into bed with ITV and C4 so that Teletext could be accessed from their channels on digital in the same way as on analogue. The difference was that on analogue, the channels didn't actually have any control of who operated the text service - this was in the gift of the ITC, and later Ofcom. As long as Teletext paid the licence fee it had bid - basically an official bribe to the government - we could continue to broadcast.</p>
<p>But on digital, things were different. The public-service bandwidth was allocated, but on a different channel. ITV and C4 had control over what happened when you pressed the Text button on their channels. And they insisted on a big payment of their own to allow us the chance to use that button to give viewers access to our service via those channels.</p>
<p>So, the business plan should have been clear: we pay the channels a fair but hopefully small amount to use the text button; viewers access our service; we sell lots of ads against that service; we profit. But, you've already spotted the flaw in the plan: no digital sales team, so no adverts. What's more, the negotiations were in the hands of the business development director, a man who had joined the company out of school ten years before and worked his way up, and had no real experience in this sort of negotiation with the really big boys of broadcasting. Plus, we had absolutely no idea how to put together a business plan. So, not altogether surprisingly, we ended up promising to pay huge amounts for the text button privilege, leaving us a mountain to climb before these services could be profitable.</p>
<p>But there might have been an alternative. Teletext (mistake number six or so, I've lost count) was obsessed by its brand. The fact that consumers didn't understand that brand at all seemed never to register. The fact was, Teletext the company was called that in order to build brand equity quickly, by calling the company the same name as the generic service. This never really worked - most people confused Teletext with Ceefax, the BBC's service, or even continued to think of the ITV/C4 service as being Oracle, which was the previous licence-holder. Notwithstanding, senior management were convinced that Teletext was a respected and trusted brand, which we should protect and use wherever possible.</p>
<p>But to be honest, the brand was not what was important about Teletext. What was important was our unrivalled experience in digital publishing and information provision. So, instead of going to ITV and saying "We'll pay you lots of money to be allowed to broadcast on your channel", we should have said "Tell you what, pay <em>us</em> lots of money and we'll allow you to broadcast our great text service on your channel, so that viewers will stay on your channel when they need to check the news or sport". So, we would have been in profit from the beginning, rather than paying huge amounts which we would have to recuperate through the non-existent advertising.</p>
<p>These were the big problems. There were other failures too, of course: failure to develop the in-house technical expertise to manage the satellite versions of the ITV and C4 text services, leaving us paying huge amounts to a third-party development house; total failure to manage the technical department properly, so that simple requests often took weeks, and complex projects overran hugely or were cancelled half-way through; gradual erosion of audience loyalty through constant renumbering of pages;</p>
<p>For me the enduring experience of working at Teletext for most of a decade was hearing the managing director get up in front of everyone each quarter and saying, in his lovely Irish brogue, that audience had continued to go down, but maybe it hadn't gone down quite as much as it could, so we were doing all right. The fact that that level of self-deception could be sustained for so long goes some way towards showing how Teletext could get in quite the mess it did.</p>
