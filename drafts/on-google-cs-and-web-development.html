        <p>So, I am leaving Google.</p>
<p>It's not entirely my decision, but neither am I particularly bitter about it.
I joined almost three years ago as a web developer for the "people development"
department, rather than in the normal engineering organisation, and was told
from the start by the recruiter that I'd find it very difficult to transition to
a proper engineering role because I don't have a computer science background.</p>
<p>In the intervening time, I've expended quite a lot of effort in trying to make
that transition happen: most recently by actually re-interviewing internally for
the "software engineering" ladder. Despite a large amount of preparation, when
it came to the real interviews I bombed: so now, since my current role is going
away and I haven't been able to move to the proper SWE one, and despite three
years of positive feedback and ratings, I'm out. (Joining Government Digital
Services, since you ask, who seem to be happy to have me.)</p>
<p>As I say, I'm not particularly bitter; all this is just scene-setting for some
thoughts on the necessity of computer science knowledge in web development jobs.</p>
<p>As I hinted above, I'm an entirely self-taught programmer. I have no computing
qualifications at all; my undergraduate degree, believe it or not, is in
European Studies, and my postgraduate diploma is in newspaper journalism. I came
into professional software development via a very circuitous route that involved
product management, charity work, redundancy, freelancing and a very large
amount of luck, and I'm eternally grateful that certain folk seem to have taken
me seriously in that role despite my odd background. (Everyone, that is, apart
from Google. Hey ho.)</p>
<p>For the first few years of my career, I didn't feel that I was missing anything
at all from my lack of CS knowledge. I was missing <em>software development</em>
knowledge - version control, release management, estimation, etc - but that came
quickly as part of working with a team. As far as programming was concerned, I'd
been doing that since I was ten (which is more years ago than I care to admit)
and while there are always new things to learn, I was pretty happy with how my
knowledge and experience stacked up against everyone else I was working with.
And, again, they were pretty happy with how I was working, too.</p>
<p>So it wasn't until I had to start studying for the transfer interviews at Google
that I spent any time learning the kinds of things I would have had to learn on
a CS course: in particular, algorithms, data structures and compilers. I
followed several courses on Coursera: the two parts of Tim Roughgarden's
algorithms course, and Alex Aiken's compilers one (and I even completed some of
them). I read several algorithms books, and did all sorts of sample questions
about graph traversal on Boggle boards and remote control keypads.</p>
<p>(As an aside, my general problem with algorithms courses has been the amount of
maths involved. I don't find I have any natural facility with maths, so even
though I understand the concepts I struggle to apply them in a theoretical
situation. It <em>is</em> possible to study algorithms without maths, and some books
take that approach - ie leaving out or allowing you to skip things like proving
the complexity of an algorithm - but most of the courses I tried had maths as an
integral part, which made it difficult for me.)</p>
<p>So, despite my failure at the Google transfer, has it made me a better
programmer? Yes, without question. It really is good to have an understanding of
what happens when you call <code>sort()</code> on a list, and know exactly why Python's
dictionaries have a constant-time lookup and how that is achieved. And it's
especially good to understand exactly what happens when you call a function, why
that might be expensive, and how you can run out of stack space.</p>
<p>But, there's another question: has it made me a better <em>web developer</em>? Well:
not really. I certainly have a better understanding of sorting algorithms</p>
<p>While it's nice to be able to point to a bit of code and say if it's O(n) or
O(n^2), to be honest I knew the difference anyway, just without the technical
terms.</p>
<p>And here's the crunch: for the type of work I do, this knowledge is esoteric at
best. I enjoy diving into complex programming problems, but in my work they're
mostly of the kind "How can I make this query in the most efficient way", and
"How can I get these separate systems to talk together properly". The answer to
those questions <em>might</em> involve graph or tree traversal; but more likely they
don't.</p>
<p>I'm never going to be the guy who invents the next MapReduce, or who implements
a better ranking algorithm for search, or who perfects voice recognition.
There's been an intern sitting next to me for the past few months who's been
doing amazing things with facial recognition: I'm never going to be able to do
what he does.</p>
<p>But I am actually quite good at what I do do. As I mentioned, even at Google
I've had nothing but positive feedback and above-average ratings. My colleagues
here and in previous companies have relied on me to produce good designs,
well-written and fully-tested code, and helpful feedback on their own code, and
I've always delivered. But that, apparently, is not what Google want. They don't
want someone who can <em>actually</em> do a job, as I have proved; they want someone
who can <em>theoretically</em> do a job, which I can't.</p>
<p>Well, that's their problem; as I say, I really am not bitter. (OK, maybe just a
bit.) It is just a same that some companies - and Google's certainly not the
only one - are so focused on recruiting "engineering generalists" that they
ignore the fact that software engineering is a very wide discipline, and it's
possible to have good skills in one corner of it without necessarily having that
theoretical underpinning. Or, as it came down to in my case, not knowing about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>.</p>
<p>In fact they do have a separate job ladder for "web developer", but that is very
much focused on front-end development. My front-end skills are fine, and I
enjoying doing that sort of thing sometimes, but it's not really where my
interest lies. I've always been more focused on the back-end, but at Google you
aren't supposed to do that unless you really are a "SWE".</p>
<p>And that's a shame: for me and other web devs who are excluded from working at
Google, and indeed for the SWEs who do work on web stuff here but are forced to
use the horribly over-engineered libraries that have been built for them to make
web development more like "proper" Java programming - GWT and Closure, I'm
looking at you. (And even though there's now big takeup of AngularJS, which is
doing a lot to change that, the powers that be still do all they can to make
working with it more like working with a statically-typed compiled language,
greatly reducing its flexibility. Frustrating. I might have more to say on this
in a future post.)</p>
